<h2><b>INFORMED CONSENT FORM</b></h2>

Please read the following informed consent form, and check the "I consent" checkbox if you would like to participate in the experiment. You will be given more specific instructions in the following screen if you choose to participate. 

<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>
<p>
    The goal of this research study is to investigate how humans and AI systems represent and process sentences.
</p>

<h3><b>PROCEDURES:</b></h3>
<p>
    You will be asked to read or listen to words, partial sentences or full sentences, after which you will be asked to do one or several of the following: respond to questions about what you read, judge how “natural” the sentences sounded, generate continuations to the sentences or select the best image or paraphrase that describes what you read. Depending on the experiment, you might also be presented with an image and asked to describe the image. The sentences may be in English or a made-up language that you will  learn during the experiment. The experiment involves a single session that will take up to an hour; there will be up to five sessions, but most participants will only participate in a single session. The experimenter will explain the specifics of the current experiment if you consent to participate.
</p>

<p>
    Some participants will have their eye movements tracked as they read the texts. Some participants might have their voice recorded as they produced sentences or words. This will be indicated to those participants both when they are recruited and immediately before the experiment.
</p>

<h3><b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:</b></h3>
<p>
    The risks associated with participation in this experiment are no greater than those encountered in daily life. 
</p>

<h3><b>BENEFITS:</b></h3>
<p>
    There are no direct benefits to you from participating in the   study. The study may benefit society 
    if it leads to a better understanding of how humans and AI models process sentences.
</p>

<h3><b>CONFIDENTIALITY:</b></h3>
<p>
    Any study records that identify you will be kept confidential to the extent possible by law. The
    records from your participation may be reviewed by people responsible for making sure that
    research is done properly, including members of the Institutional Review Board at Colgate University and 
    officials from government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Office for Human 
    Research Protections. (All of these people are required to keep your identity confidential.) Otherwise, 
    records that identify you will be available only to people working on the study, unless you give permission 
    for other people to see the records. Any study records that include your name will be kept in a locked file 
    cabinet. On all records of test results we will use a code number rather than your name.
</p>

h3><b>COMPENSATION:</b></h3>
You will be compensated through Prolific upon completing this study and entering the completion code.
<h3><b>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS:</b></h3>
<p>
    You can ask questions about this research study now or at any time during the study, by emailing Dr. Grusha Prasad at gprasad@colgate.edu</p>
<p>
        If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or feel that you have not been treated fairly, please email the Chair of the Institutional Review Board at Colgate University at IRB_chair@psych.colgate.edu
